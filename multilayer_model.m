% Reflection and transmission coefficient calculator of lossy multilayer 

%This program produces the complex reflection and transmission coefficients
%of a multilayer stack given the angle of incidence, polarization,
%wavelength, complex-refractive index of each layer, and thickness of each
%layer. The program assumes lossless dielectric incident and exit media. 
%The program also assumes that all layers are non-magnetic. Magnetic media
%can be handled by more general theory (see technical report cited below). 

%This program was inspired by the technical report written by K. Pascoe, 
%"Reflectivity and Transmissivity through Layered, Lossy Media: A
%User-Friendly Approach," 2001. See the following link for the technical
%paper:

%only find the sine of the complex angle from snells law. So we use the
